# Lightspeed-Dump
A dump of lightspeed, with some leaked product keys for testing purposes.

> Any keys leaked within this repository are not meant to be abused; they are simply for people to test lightspeed properly. Please send an issue here if your key was leaked, we will remove it. Find these keys at `_keys.txt`. Sorry that your school got leaked to whoever leaked it.

Since this is meant for testing purposes I'm hoping you already know how to install this.

This dump uses one of the leaked keys. If you want, you can swap keys, follow these steps:

- Open the extension code
- Replace all mentions of this string: `6d1314a021a4f3e7b0a27aa37cc4ccbb1484a5e92dc878e5cb3eb239249e6ee9` with your key in `main.js`
- Do the same for `manifest.json`
