# Lightspeed-Dump
A dump of lightspeed, with some leaked product keys for testing purposes.

> Any keys leaked within this repository are not meant to be abused; they are simply for people to test lightspeed properly. Please send an issue here if your key was leaked, we will remove it. Find these keys at `_keys.txt`. Sorry that your school got leaked to whoever leaked it.

Since this is meant for testing purposes I'm hoping you already know how to install this.

This dump uses one of the leaked keys. If you want, you can swap keys, follow these steps:

- Change the update URL using the key

- read the XML file and find the download link to chromefilter crx

- upload it to [https://robwu.nl](robwu.nl)'s extension reader/opener

- download as zip, unzip the files and there you go.
